# ICON-ESM Climate Simulations for a "Flat Earth" scenario (removed orography)

How does Earths land surface relief affect climate? Or the other way round: What would be if there were no mountain ranges and depressions and the surface was completely flat?

This question was addressed with climate model simulations and analyses at the Earth System Modelling School (EaSyMS) at the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology in September 2022. Simulations for this scenario were performed with the [ICON-ESM](https://mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/models/icon-esm) and compared with an undisturbed control run. Minimal parameter changes yielded an ensemble of three model realizations which were averaged to account for internal variability. The model ran for 500 years, respectively, of which the last 50 years were averaged and used for analysis. The lowest resolution configuration of the ICON-ESM ([Ruby SWITCH](https://mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/modeling-with-icon/icon-configurations/icon-ruby-icon-esm)) was used, having grid cell sizes around 320 km (R2B3) in the atmosphere and 160 km (R2B4) in the ocean.
